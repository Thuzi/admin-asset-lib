			<h4>This project was created to house the default styles and components for all Thuzi admins apps.</h4>
			<p>The project contains styles for all the basic elements and some for more complex components.</p>
			<p>Any new components that are created that can be used in a universal manor should be added to this project. As well as any updated basic element styles.</p>
			<p>The project should be installed to all thuzi admins via <a target="_blank" href="https://bower.io" >bower</a>. All Thuzi developers should have access to the <a href="https://github.com/Thuzi/admin-asset-lib" target="_blank" >repo in github</a>.</p>
			<pre><code>bower install git@github.com:Thuzi/admin-asset-lib.git --save</code></pre>

			<h3>Dependencies</h3>
			<p>All dependencies will be installed if not already present when you install the package from bower. It does this based on the dependencies defined in the bower.json.</p>
			<p>The project will appear in the bower_components folder as if it where any other package.</p>
			<p><i>(can be updated as needed, or based on new releases)</i></p>

			<ul>
				<li>Angular.js</li>
				<li>Angular-Animate</li>
				<li>Angular-Bootstrap</li>
				<li>Angular-Route</li>
				<li>Less.js</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Using the Less Files</h3>
			<p>Each less file in the css/less folder was created to house very specific CSS. All the CSS in each less file is done in a mobile first and Object Oriented manor. This is to increase and promote re-use of existing styles to decrease page bloat.</p>
			<p><i>More less files can be added as needed when more components are created. A new less file should be added for any and all new components.</i> </p>

			<h3>Variables.less</h3>
			<p>The variables.less file is used to elimiate the need to add the same value to properties across all .less files. It also allows updates to specific values to be done much more simple because it is only defined in one place.</p>

			<h3>Fonts</h3>
			<p>The default font in the typography.less is a google web font called Open Sans. It has the 400, 600 and 700 weight versions. With and Wihout italics.</p>
			<pre><code>@import url(https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,400italic,600,600italic,700,700italic);</code></pre>

			<p>There is also the icon font <a target="_blank" href="http://fontawesome.io" >Font Awesome</a> that is used and avalible. The css for it is housed directly in the css folder. The fonts folder houses the web font files, in the formats .eot, .svg, .ttf, .woff, .woff2, and .otf.</p>
